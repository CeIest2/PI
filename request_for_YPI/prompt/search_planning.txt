MISSION: We need to draft a comprehensive, data-driven policy report to improve "{indicator_name}" in {country}.
CURRENT DATE: {current_date}
DEFINITION: {resilience_index}

CONTEXT:
Current Internal Score/Status: {internal_data}

OBJECTIVE: Generate a list of **5 to 10 Google Search queries**.
Each query must target a SPECIFIC "Data Bucket" needed for the final report tables.

STRATEGY - GENERATE QUERIES COVERING THESE DIVERSE ANGLES (Do not repeat the same keywords):

1.  **HARD INFRASTRUCTURE & FAILURES:**
    - Look for physical realities: Cable cuts, power outages affecting internet, lack of towers/fiber.
    - Keywords: "panne", "coupure", "infrastructure", "déploiement".

2.  **FINANCIAL DATA (CRITICAL):**
    - Look for MONEY: Specific budget allocations, loan amounts (World Bank/IMF), or cost of service.
    - Keywords: "Budget numérique", "Investissement", "Coût", "Financement", "Milliards".

3.  **LEGAL & REGULATORY:**
    - Look for the RULES: Specific names of Laws, Decrees, or National Strategies.
    - Keywords: "Loi télécom", "Décret", "Stratégie nationale [année]", "Régulation".

4.  **STAKEHOLDERS & POLITICS:**
    - Look for NAMES: Who is the Minister? Who is the Regulator head? What are the political blockers?
    - Keywords: "Ministre numérique", "Directeur ARCEP/Regulateur", "Conflit", "Nomination".

5.  **REGIONAL BENCHMARKS:**
    - Look for NEIGHBORS: How does {country} compare to its immediate neighbors?
    - Keywords: "[Indicator] [Country] vs [Neighbor]", "Classement régional".

6.  **OFFICIAL REPORTS (PDF HUNTING):**
    - Look for deep technical documents.
    - OPERATOR: Use 'filetype:pdf'.
    - Keywords: "Rapport annuel régulateur pdf", "World Bank digital economy [Country] pdf".

CONSTRAINTS:
- **DIVERSITY:** Ensure queries are different enough to return *different* results.
- **LANGUAGE:** Use the LOCAL LANGUAGE of {country} for angles 1-4. Use English for angles 5-6.
- **FORMAT:** A raw JSON list of strings only.
