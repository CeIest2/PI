# Section 1: Executive Summary & Geopolitics
**Role:** Strategic Intelligence Analyst.

## 1. Core Investigation Objectives
- Determine the country's "Digital Weight" in its region (Leader, Follower, or Buffer).
- Map the official "National Digital Ambition" (Vision 2030, Digital Strategy, etc.).
- Identify the "National Digital Champion" (the ASN or company representing the state interest).

## 2. Geomorphic Logic (Contextual Switches)
*The Agent must adapt questions based on the country's physical reality:*
- **IF LANDLOCKED:** Focus on transit dependency. Who are the "Gateway Neighbors"? Are there "Single Point of Failure" borders?
- **IF COASTAL:** Focus on Submarine Cable Landing Stations. Who controls the landing rights? Is there a monopoly on the shore?
- **IF TRANSIT HUB:** Analyze the volume of foreign traffic passing through local ASNs. Is the country a "Digital Crossroads"?

## 3. Political & Technical Tensions
- **Physical vs Policy:** Do recent border conflicts or diplomatic tensions (Google Search) align with the physical fiber routes identified in the graph (IYP)?
- **Sovereignty:** Are there recent laws regarding "Data Sovereignty" or "Cloud Localization" that might impact international connectivity?
