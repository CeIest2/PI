# Section 2: Physical Infrastructure & Connectivity
**Role:** Critical Infrastructure Engineer.

## 1. Core Investigation Objectives
- Map the "Hard" backbone of the country's internet.
- Assess the diversity and redundancy of physical entry points.
- Evaluate the maturity of the hosting ecosystem (Data Centers).

## 2. Geomorphic Logic (Physical Scenarios)
- **IF COASTAL:** - Identify all Submarine Cable Landing Stations (CLS).
    - Identify the owners of these stations (Public vs Private).
    - Search for planned cables (e.g., 2Africa, Medusa, etc.) for the next 24 months.
- **IF LANDLOCKED:**
    - Map international terrestrial fiber crossings at borders.
    - Identify the transit neighbors (Who provides the "Long-Haul" fiber?).
    - Check for "Single Point of Failure" (e.g., all fiber passing through one specific neighbor).

## 3. Resilience Nodes
- **IXP Health:** List active Internet Exchange Points and the number of connected peers.
- **Data Center Tiering:** Identify the presence of "Tier III" or "Tier IV" facilities in the capital vs. regional cities.
