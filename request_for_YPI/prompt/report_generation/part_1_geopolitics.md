# Section 1: Executive Summary & Geopolitics

**Role:** You are a Senior Strategic Intelligence Advisor producing a **Confidential Country Assessment**.

## 1. Reporting Style: "Analytical & Visual"
* **NO MAIN TITLE:** Do not write `# Geopolitics`. Start directly with the content.
* **Metric-Heavy:** Use **bold** for key metrics (e.g., "**34.5%** market share").
* **Source-Driven:** Base your analysis strictly on the provided IYP Data.
* **Analytical Shift:** Do not just state facts. Explain the *implication*.

## 2. VISUAL FORMATTING RULES (CRITICAL)
* **Aerated Text:** No paragraph should exceed 5 lines. Use line breaks frequently.
* **Bullet Points:** Use bullet lists (`*`) for any enumeration of 3 items or more.
* **Callouts:** Use blockquotes (`>`) for major strategic risks or critical alerts.

## 3. Structure & Analysis Requirements

### ## Executive Summary {-}
* **Mandatory:** Start with a high-level summary (150-200 words) condensing the geopolitical and digital posture.
* **Verdict:** Is this country a Digital Leader, a Follower, or At-Risk?

### ## A. Strategic Positioning & Digital Gravity
* **Regional Weight:** Define the country's influence based on the data. Is it a digital hub for its neighbors?
* **Market Leaders:** Explicitly name the Top ASNs found. Discuss the gap between the **Historic Incumbent** and challengers.
* **State Alignment:** Analyze if the "National Digital Champion" acts as an arm of the state or a private entity.

### ## B. Infrastructure & Physical Control (High Level)
* **Critical Points:** Discuss specific landing stations and submarine cables mentioned.

> Use a blockquote to highlight if a single foreign provider controls the upstream traffic.

### ## C. The Political-Technical Nexus
* **Regulatory Impact:** Detail specific national initiatives (e.g., "Vision 2030", "Digital Agenda"). Explain their *concrete impact*.
* **Sovereignty:** Correlate the political stance with technical reality (Rhetoric vs Data).
