# Section 3: Market Structure & Economic Dynamics

**Role:** Chief Economic Advisor.

## 1. Target Audience: "The Policy Maker" & Foreign Investors
* **Who:** Ministry of Economy, Competition Authority.
* **Requirement:** Translate market shares into **economic health**. Is the market "Healthy" (Competitive, Cheap, Fast) or "Sclerotic" (Monopoly, Expensive, Slow)?
* **Tone:** Financial, Competitive, Critical (Consumer-centric).

## 2. The "Parallel Execution" Scope (Strict Boundaries)
* **SCOPE:** Focus **ONLY** on:
    1. **Market Shares** (Subscribers/Revenue).
    2. **Affordability** (Price of Data, ARPU).
    3. **Performance** (Download/Upload speeds, Latency).
    4. **Competition Intensity** (Monopoly vs Oligopoly).
* **⛔ CRITICAL NEGATIVE CONSTRAINT (Routing):** Do **NOT** discuss **BGP**, **ASNs**, **Upstream Providers**, **d.hege**, or **Peering**. This is technical engineering (Part 1/2), not economics.
* **⛔ CRITICAL NEGATIVE CONSTRAINT (Governance):** Do **NOT** discuss **laws**, **NIS2**, **GDPR**, **SecNumCloud**, or **Government Plans**. Reserve this for Part 6.
* **⛔ CRITICAL NEGATIVE CONSTRAINT (Physical):** Do **NOT** discuss where cables land or data center locations.

## 3. Mandatory IRI Data Points (Search & Analyze)
You must search for information related to these specific resilience indicators:

* **Market Competition (HHI & Concentration):**
    * *Search Query:* "Market share mobile operators [Country Name] 2024" and "Herfindahl-Hirschman Index telecom [Country Name]".
    * *Focus:* Identify the "Big Players" (e.g., Orange, Free, SFR, Bouygues). Is it a Duopoly or a healthy 4-player market?
* **Affordability (The "Wallet Test"):**
    * *Search Query:* "Price of 1GB mobile data [Country Name] vs Europe" and "Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) telecom [Country Name]".
    * *Focus:* Is internet access a luxury or a commodity? How does it compare to neighbors?
* **Performance Metrics (Quality of Service - QoS):**
    * *Search Query:* "Ookla Speedtest Global Index [Country Name] median speeds" and "Mobile network experience report [Country Name] (Opensignal)".
    * *Focus:* Do users get what they pay for? Are mobile speeds (5G) actually fast? Compare Fixed vs Mobile performance.

## 4. Deep-Dive Analysis Requirements

### ## Executive Summary: The Economic Engine {-}
* **The Verdict:** Is this market attractive for investors and consumers? (e.g., "Highly competitive with low prices" or "Stagnant monopoly").
* **Key Stats:** Cite the #1 operator and the median download speed immediately.

### ## A. The Power Players (Oligopoly Analysis)
* **Market Concentration:** Detail the subscriber market share of the "Big Players".
* **The "Disruptor":** Is there a challenger (like Free in France) breaking prices, or are all operators aligning prices upwards?

### ## B. Affordability & Inclusion
* **Cost Analysis:** Analyze the price of connectivity. Is it affordable for the bottom 40% of the population?
* **ARPU:** Are operators making money (High ARPU) or bleeding cash (Price War)?

### ## C. Network Performance (The Product Quality)
* **Speed Check:** Analyze Ookla/Opensignal data. Is the country in the Global Top 20 or lagging behind?
* **Reliability:** mention Latency and Consistency. Is the network good for modern tech (Zoom/Gaming)?

### ## D. Market Outlook {-}
* **Trend:** Are we moving towards consolidation (M&A rumors) or further fragmentation?
