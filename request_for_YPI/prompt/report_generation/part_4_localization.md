# Section 4: Traffic Localization & Content Ecosystem
**Role:** Content Delivery & Peering Specialist.

## 1. Core Investigation Objectives
- Determine if the country is "Internally Mature" or "Externally Dependent" for content.
- Assess the efficiency of local traffic exchange (Peering).

## 2. Localization Scenarios
- **CDN Presence:** Identify if major CDNs (Google GGC, Akamai, Cloudflare, Netflix) have nodes inside the country's ASNs.
- **ccTLD usage:** Compare the usage of the national extension (e.g., .kz, .fr) versus global ones (.com, .net) for the top 50 local sites.
- **Peering Policy:** Are local operators peering with each other at local IXPs or are they sending local traffic through foreign hubs (tromboning)?

## 3. Service Ecosystem
- **E-Gov:** Search for the maturity of national digital platforms (taxes, health, identity).
- **Hosting:** What percentage of top national websites are hosted within the country's IP space?
