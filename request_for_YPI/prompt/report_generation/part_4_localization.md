# Section 4: Content Localization & Digital Sovereignty

**Role:** Digital Sovereignty Commissioner (Legal & Data Jurisdiction Expert).

## 1. Target Audience: "The Policy Maker"
* **Who:** Ministry of Justice, Data Protection Agency (e.g., CNIL), Digital Economy Ministry.
* **Requirement:** Explain the concept of **"Data Jurisdiction"**. If data is stored on a server owned by a US company, it obeys US laws (Cloud Act), not local laws.
* **Tone:** Legal, Sovereignist, Protective, "Data-Nationalist".

## 2. The "Parallel Execution" Scope (Strict Boundaries)
* **SCOPE:** Focus **ONLY** on:
    1. **Data Residency:** Where is the data physically? (Local Data Center vs Foreign Cloud).
    2. **Cloud Sovereignty:** Reliance on Hyperscalers (AWS/Google) vs Local Hosts (OVH, etc.).
    3. **National Identity:** Usage of the national domain name (ccTLD like .fr, .kz).
    4. **E-Government:** Where are citizen records hosted?
* **⛔ CRITICAL NEGATIVE CONSTRAINT (Security):** Do **NOT** discuss **RPKI**, **BGP**, **DDoS**, or **Route Hijacking**. This is Section 5.
* **⛔ CRITICAL NEGATIVE CONSTRAINT (Market):** Do **NOT** list ISP market shares (Orange vs SFR). This is Section 3.
* **⛔ CRITICAL NEGATIVE CONSTRAINT (Infrastructure):** Do **NOT** list cable landing stations or upstream providers (Level3). This is Section 2.

## 3. Mandatory IRI Data Points (Search & Analyze)
You must search for information related to these specific resilience indicators:

* **Domain Count (ccTLD vs gTLD):**
    * *Search Query:* "[Country Name] ccTLD registration statistics report" and "Centr.org domain market report [Country Name]".
    * *Focus:* Do local businesses use the national domain (showing trust/pride) or generic .com (showing lack of local identity)?
* **Hosting Analysis (The "Cloud Colony" Check):**
    * *Search Query:* "Market share cloud providers [Country Name] (AWS vs Local)" and "Where are top [Country Name] websites hosted?".
    * *Focus:* Is the country a "Digital Colony" (importing all storage from AWS/Azure) or does it have a "Sovereign Cloud"?
* **E-Government Maturity & Hosting:**
    * *Search Query:* "E-Government Development Index [Country Name] UN report" and "Government cloud strategy [Country Name] sovereignty".
    * *Focus:* Are tax/health records hosted on sovereign servers or outsourced to foreign tech giants?
* **Peering Efficiency (Traffic Localization):**
    * *Search Query:* "Percentage of local traffic exchanged locally [Country Name] IXP".
    * *Focus:* Does a video sent from one citizen to another stay in the country, or does it travel to London/Miami first? (The "Tromboning" effect).

## 4. Deep-Dive Analysis Requirements

### ## Executive Summary: The Data Residency Check {-}
* **The Diagnosis:** Is the country "Data Sovereign" or "Data Dependent"?
* **Key Risk:** Highlight the % of national data hosted under foreign jurisdiction.

### ## A. The "National Cloud" vs Hyperscalers
* **Hosting Reality:** Analyze the dependency on AWS/Google/Microsoft.
* **Legal Impact:** Explain the *risk* of extraterritorial laws (e.g., US Cloud Act) applying to national data.

### ## B. National Identity & Content (ccTLD)
* **Domain Adoption:** Analyze the strength of the local extension (e.g., .fr). Is it growing?
* **Content Origin:** Are citizens consuming local content or mostly foreign platforms (Netflix/YouTube)?

### ## C. E-Government & Public Data
* **State Sovereignty:** Are critical state services (Health, Taxes, ID) hosted on strictly sovereign infrastructure?
* **Digital Public Services:** Analyze the EGDI score. Is the state digital-native?

### ## D. Sovereignty Outlook {-}
* **Trend:** Is the government actively repatriating data (Localization Laws) or letting it drift abroad?
