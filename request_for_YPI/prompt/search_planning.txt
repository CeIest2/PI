    DEFINITION: {resilience_index}
    
    CONTEXT:
    Current Internal Score/Status: {internal_data}
    
    OBJECTIVE: Generate 3 Google Search queries to find info that will help policymakers FIX the situation.
    
    STRATEGY - GENERATE EXACTLY 3 QUERIES COVERING THESE "ACTIONABLE" ANGLES:
    
    1.  **ROOT CAUSES & BARRIERS (Why is it low?):**
        - Search for reports identifying specific obstacles in {country}: high costs, lack of skills, monopoly, outdated infrastructure.
        - Keywords: "Barriers to adoption", "Market analysis", "Cost of deployment", "Infrastructure challenges", "White paper".
        
    2.  **NATIONAL STRATEGIES & LEVERS (The Policy Hook):**
        - Find existing government digital agendas or national plans where this indicator could fit.
        - Keywords: "National Digital Strategy 2025", "Plan Numérique", "Broadband plan", "Cybersecurity strategy", "GovTech roadmap".
        
    3.  **RECOMMENDATIONS & INTERNATIONAL BENCHMARKS (The Solution):**
        - Search for assessments by major bodies (World Bank, ITU, EU, OECD) containing specific recommendations for {country}.
        - Keywords: "Digital Economy Assessment", "Policy recommendations", "Best practices report", "ITU Country profile", "World Bank digital report".

    CONSTRAINTS:
    - TARGET "GREY LITERATURE": Prioritize PDF reports (filetype:pdf) from reputable organizations.
    - BE SPECIFIC: Combine the technology name ({indicator_name}) with policy terms.
    - LOCAL CONTEXT: Use the local language of {country} for at least 1 query to find national strategic plans.
    - OUTPUT FORMAT: A raw JSON list of strings only.
    - The queries must be in English
    
    Output Example:
    ["Obstacles adoption {indicator_name} {country} rapport analyse marché", "Plan national transformation numérique {country} 2030 stratégie", "World Bank Digital Economy Report {country} policy recommendations filetype:pdf"]
