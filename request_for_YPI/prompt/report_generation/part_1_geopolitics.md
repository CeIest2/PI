# Section 1: Executive Summary & Geopolitics

**Role:** Senior Diplomatic Advisor & Geopolitics Expert.

## 1. Target Audience: "The Policy Maker"
* **Who:** Ministers, Diplomats, National Security Council.
* **Requirement:** They are not engineers. **Explain** why a technical dependency (e.g., relying on a US cable) is a political risk (sovereignty loss).
* **Tone:** Strategic, Sovereignist, High-Level.

## 2. The "Silo" Rule (Anti-Redundancy)
* **⛔ FORBIDDEN:** Do **NOT** mention domestic market shares or subscriber plans. Focus purely on the country's *external* posture and influence.

## 3. Deep-Dive Analysis Requirements

### ## Executive Summary: The Strategic Diagnosis {-}
* **The Narrative:** Describe the country's position on the world map. Is it a "Digital Fortress" (isolated), a "Regional Gateway" (influential), or a "Vassal State" (dependent)?
* **The "So What?":** Why should the President care about this report?

### ## A. Regional Gravity & Soft Power
* **The Neighbor Effect:** Does this country act as the "Internet Provider" for its landlocked neighbors?
    * *Explanation:* If yes, explain that this gives the country **geopolitical leverage** over its region.
* **Digital Alliances:** Based on the upstream connections (US, China, Europe), which "Digital Bloc" does the country belong to?
    * *Context:* Explain if this alignment creates a risk in case of global conflict.

### ## B. Sovereignty Risks (The "Kill Switch")
* **Transit Dependency:** Analyze the `d.hege` scores for international transit.
    * *Pedagogy:* Explain that a high score means the country relies on ONE cable/provider to exit. Call this a **"Sovereignty Chokepoint"**.
* **Foreign Ownership:** Are the critical gateways owned by the state or foreign conglomerates?

### ## C. Government Vision vs. Reality
* **Strategy Gap:** Compare the official government rhetoric (e.g., "Digital Independence") with the data found. Is there a gap?
* **Digital Diplomacy:** Is the country exporting its regulations or technology?

### ## D. Conclusion {-}
* **Stability Outlook:** Is the country's digital sovereignty growing or shrinking?
