QUESTION : Q1 [IYP-GRAPH]: What are the top 10 ASNs by `r.percent` (Population) and `cone:numberAsns` (Topological weight) within Kazakhstan, and what is their `d.hege` (inter-dependency) score?
RÉPONSE :
Technical data for `cone:numberAsns` (Topological weight) within Kazakhstan is currently unavailable.

The top 10 ASNs in Kazakhstan by `r.percent` (Population) are: KAZTELECOM-AS JSC Kazakhtelecom (25.73%), ipnet_kar-tel Kar-Tel LLC (19.37%), TELE2-KZ Mobile Telecom-Service LLP (17.19%), KCELL-AS Kcell JSC (11.13%), KAR-TEL-AS Kar-Tel LLC (9.58%), ALTEL-AS Mobile Telecom-Service LLP (3.16%), ALMANET-AS JSC Alma Telecommunications (2.61%), asnls NLS Kazakhstan LLC (2.18%), TTC-AS JSC Transtelecom (2.02%), and OPTINET-AS Optinet LLP (0.66%). Using population reach as a proxy for market share, their inter-dependency (`d.hege`) scores are: KAZTELECOM-AS (0.20), ipnet_kar-tel (0.30), TELE2-KZ (0.20), KCELL-AS (0.39), KAR-TEL-AS (0.20), ALTEL-AS (0.34), ALMANET-AS (0.25), asnls (0.21), TTC-AS (0.27), and OPTINET-AS (0.31). A higher `d.hege` score indicates greater dependency on that ASN.

QUESTION : Q2 [GOOGLE-SEARCH]: Identify the primary state-owned or state-affiliated entities that operate the top 3 ASNs identified in Q1, and their stated strategic objectives for Kazakhstan's digital infrastructure.

QUESTION : Q5 [IYP-GRAPH]: Identify the top 5 upstream providers for the national incumbent ASN in Kazakhstan. What is the `d.hege` score of these upstream providers, and do they have significant inter-dependencies with other ASNs within Kazakhstan?
RÉPONSE :
The top upstream providers for the national incumbent ASN in Kazakhstan, based on the number of other ASNs depending on them, are CLOUDFLARENET (956 dependencies), TTC-AS JSC Transtelecom (149 dependencies), KAZTELECOM-AS JSC Kazakhtelecom (119 dependencies), KTC-AS Jusan Mobile JSC (58 dependencies), and KAR-TEL-AS Kar-Tel LLC (29 dependencies) ``. The `d.hege` score for dependencies pointing towards central ASNs in Kazakhstan is 1.0 for all analyzed dependent ASNs, indicating 100% dependency and significant centralization for these providers ``. Technical data for `cone:numberAsns` is currently unavailable ``.
------------------------------------------------------------

QUESTION : Q6 [IYP-GRAPH]: What is the prevalence of MANRS (Mutually Agreed Norms for Routing Security) implementation among the top 10 ASNs in Kazakhstan, and what are the common security tags (e.g., DNSSEC, BGPsec) associated with their prefixes?
RÉPONSE :
Among the top 10 ASNs in Kazakhstan, none have implemented MANRS (Mutually Agreed Norms for Routing Security). Technical data for security tags such as DNSSEC and BGPsec associated with the prefixes of these top 10 ASNs is currently unavailable, with all listed ASNs showing a null value for `SecurityTag` and a prefix count of 0.
------------------------------------------------------------

QUESTION : Q7 [IYP-GRAPH]: Analyze OONI data for Kazakhstan to identify any significant trends in TCP, DNS, or HTTP blocking. Correlate these blocking events with specific ASNs or geographic regions within Kazakhstan.
RÉPONSE :
Technical data for TCP, DNS, and HTTP blocking in Kazakhstan, correlated with specific ASNs, is currently unavailable. The provided OONI data yielded no results for these investigative intents.
------------------------------------------------------------

QUESTION : Q8 [IYP-GRAPH]: Identify the top 5 Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) by membership and traffic volume within Kazakhstan. What is the `d.hege` score of the ASNs that are members of these top IXPs?
RÉPONSE :
Kazakhstan's top Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) by membership are KazNIX with 25 members and KAZ-GOV-IX with 19 members. Data for traffic volume at IXPs within Kazakhstan is currently unavailable. The `d.hege` scores for ASNs that are members of these top IXPs by membership are all 1.0, indicating 100% dependency for these ASNs. This suggests a high degree of centralization and potential vulnerability among the member ASNs of these IXPs.
------------------------------------------------------------

QUESTION : Q9 [IYP-GRAPH]: Map the presence of major Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) within Kazakhstan by analyzing DNS query shares (`QUERIED_FROM`) and node tags. Identify which ASNs are most heavily utilized for CDN traffic.
RÉPONSE :
Technical data for CDN presence within Kazakhstan, including DNS query shares and node tags, is currently unavailable. Consequently, the ASNs most heavily utilized for CDN traffic and their dependency relationships cannot be identified from the provided results.
------------------------------------------------------------
