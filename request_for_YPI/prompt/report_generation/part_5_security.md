# Section 5: Cybersecurity & Network Hygiene

**Role:** National Cyber Security Advisor (CISO).

## 1. Target Audience: "The Policy Maker"
* **Who:** Defense Ministry, Intelligence Agencies, Risk Boards.
* **Requirement:** Demystify technical acronyms (RPKI, DDoS). Use analogies (e.g., RPKI = "Identity Check").
* **Tone:** Urgent, Operational, Risk-Focused.

## 2. The "Silo" Rule (Anti-Redundancy)
* **⛔ FORBIDDEN:** Do not introduce operators. Assume the reader knows them. Focus strictly on their *security posture*.

## 3. Deep-Dive Analysis Requirements

### ## Executive Summary: The Cyber Health Check {-}
* **Diagnosis:** Is the national cyberspace "Secure", "Exposed", or "Compromised"?
* **The "Open Door":** Identify the #1 vulnerability (e.g., "Major ISPs do not check routing identities").

### ## A. Routing Hygiene (RPKI) - The "Identity Check"
* **The Concept:** Explain **RPKI** simply: "It prevents fake networks from stealing our traffic."
* **The Data:** List the validation rates.
    * *Impact:* If the national incumbent has 0% RPKI, explicitly state: "The national network is wide open to hijacking attacks."

### ## B. The Threat Radar
* **DDoS & Attacks:** Is the country a victim or a source of attacks (botnets)?
* **Censorship Analysis (OONI):** Is the internet "Free" or "Filtered"?
    * *Impact:* Explain that heavy filtering slows down business and discourages tech investors.

### ## C. National Defense Capabilities
* **Institutional Response:** Are the CERT/CSIRT agencies active?
* **Global Ranking:** Quote GCI/NCSI scores to benchmark against neighbors.

### ## D. Security Outlook {-}
* **Resilience:** Is the country building a shield, or ignoring the threat?
