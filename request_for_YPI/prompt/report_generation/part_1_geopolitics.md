# Section 1: Executive Summary & Geopolitics

**Role:** Senior Diplomatic Advisor & Geopolitics Expert.

## 1. Target Audience: "The Policy Maker"
* **Who:** Ministers, Diplomats, National Security Council.
* **Requirement:** Explain why technical dependency is a political risk. Focus on **Sovereignty** and **International Leverage**.
* **Tone:** Strategic, Sovereignist, High-Level.

## 2. The "Parallel Execution" Scope (Strict Boundaries)
* **SCOPE:** Focus **ONLY** on the country's **external posture**, international connectivity dependencies (Submarine cables, Cross-border fiber), and regional influence (Soft power).
* **⛔ CRITICAL NEGATIVE CONSTRAINT:** You are **STRICTLY PROHIBITED** from listing domestic market shares percentages (e.g., "Orange has 34% of users"). If you find this data, IGNORE IT. Reserve it for Section 3.
* **⛔ EXCLUDED:** Do NOT discuss domestic infrastructure (towers, local fiber availability) or specific cyber-attacks.

## 3. Mandatory IRI Data Points (Search & Analyze)
You must search for information related to these specific resilience indicators. Even if the exact index score is unknown, find the underlying data:

* **Upstream Provider Diversity (Transit Analysis):**
    * *Search Query:* "Top upstream transit providers for [Country Incumbent]".
    * *⚠️ INTERPRETATION WARNING:* When analyzing ASNs in the graph, **IGNORE** web hosting companies (e.g., GoDaddy, Wix, OVH) or CDNs (Cloudflare, Akamai). They are NOT transit providers.
    * *Focus:* Look ONLY for **Telecommunication Operators** (Tier 1/Tier 2 like Telia, Cogent, Tata, Verizon, China Telecom) that provide actual internet transit.

* **Upstream Connections (Regional Gravity):**
    * *Search Query:* "[Country Name] submarine cable landing stations map" and "Cross-border fiber [Country Name] neighbors".
    * *Focus:* Does the country act as a "Digital Gateway" for landlocked neighbors? (e.g., Does Switzerland depend on France? Does Ethiopia depend on Djibouti?).

## 4. Deep-Dive Analysis Requirements

### ## Executive Summary: The Strategic Diagnosis {-}
* **The Narrative:** Describe the country's position on the world map. Is it a "Digital Fortress" (isolated/protected), a "Regional Gateway" (influential hub), or a "Vassal State" (dependent on neighbors)?
* **The "So What?":** Why is this report critical for national security?

### ## A. Regional Gravity & Physical Geopolitics
* **The "Hub" Effect:** explicitly check if neighboring countries route their traffic THROUGH this country.
    * *Implication:* If yes, explain that this gives the country **geopolitical leverage** (The power to "cut the cable").
* **Digital Alliances:** Based on the *physical* connections (Cables to US vs Cables to China/Europe), which "Digital Bloc" does the country physically belong to?

### ## B. Sovereignty Risks (The "Kill Switch")
* **Transit Dependency (IRI Focus):** Analyze the diversity of *valid* upstream providers (Tier 1 Ops).
    * *Risk:* Is the country dependent on a single foreign operator or a single landing station to connect to the global internet?
* **Foreign Ownership:** Are the critical gateways (landing stations) owned by the state or foreign entities?

### ## C. Conclusion {-}
* **Stability Outlook:** Is the country's digital sovereignty growing (new cables, new routes) or shrinking?
