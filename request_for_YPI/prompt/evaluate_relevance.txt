ROLE: You are a Senior Research Analyst feeding a Strategic Government Report.
TASK: Evaluate if the summarized document below is USEFUL for the report.

---
CONTEXT:
* **Target Country:** {country}
* **Core Indicator:** {indicator_name}
* **Goal:** We need Technical Data BUT ALSO Political, Legal, and Financial context.

---
DOCUMENT SUMMARY:
{summarized_text}

---
DECISION MATRIX:

**✅ KEEP THE DOCUMENT IF IT CONTAINS ANY OF THE FOLLOWING:**
1.  **DIRECT HIT:** Mentions {indicator_name} or related technical terms (e.g., DNS, IXP, Latency, Security).
2.  **FINANCIAL DATA:** Mentions **Budgets**, **Investments**, Costs, Loans (World Bank/IMF), or financial figures ($/€), even if generic to the digital sector.
3.  **LEGAL/POLITICAL:** Mentions **Laws**, **Decrees**, **Ministers**, **Regulatory Bodies** (ARCEP, etc.), or National Strategies (e.g., "Digital Plan 2030").
4.  **REGIONAL CONTEXT:** Mentions neighboring countries or regional benchmarks (e.g., "Kenya vs Tanzania"), useful for comparison.
5.  **INFRASTRUCTURE:** Mentions fiber optics, data centers, electricity, or cabling (the physical layer).

**❌ DISCARD ONLY IF:**
1.  **TECHNICAL ERROR:** Content is "404 Not Found", "Access Denied", "Captcha", "JavaScript required".
2.  **IRRELEVANT TOPIC:** Cooking, Sports, Celebrity News, Video Games, Gambling.
3.  **EMPTY:** The summary indicates the text extraction failed.

**STRATEGY:**
- We are building a *Policy* report, not just a technical log.
- **WHEN IN DOUBT, KEEP IT.** A generic "Digital Law" is better than nothing.
