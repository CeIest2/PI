* **Regulatory Independence:**
    * *Search Query:* "Is [Country Name] telecom regulator independent?", "[Regulator Name] funding and appointment process".
    * *Focus:* Can the regulator punish the incumbent operator, or is it a "Rubber Stamp"?
* **Censorship & Shutdowns (The "Kill Switch" Law):**
    * *Search Query:* "Internet shutdown history [Country Name] (Access Now)", "Freedom on the Net [Country Name] score".
    * *Focus:* Does the state legally have the right to cut the internet? Have they done it recently?
* **Surveillance & Privacy:**
    * *Search Query:* "Data protection law [Country Name] GDPR equivalent", "State surveillance laws [Country Name]".
    * *Focus:* Are citizens' data protected from the companies AND the state?
* **International Treaties:**
    * *Search Query:* "[Country Name] Budapest Convention on Cybercrime ratification".
    * *Focus:* Is the country isolated or part of the international legal order?
